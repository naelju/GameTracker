# GameTracker
A simple project to track what games I've played, with additional feature coming along the way

To run the app:
pnpm run dev

Ideas to improve the app
Better overall design/UI
Add a game rating feature
Add a favorite top-3 games or something
Add a different view than the table view (maybe an image based one kinda like steam library)# Deployment fix

To deploy my changes:
Just run npm run deploy, yo ucan verify that a push happened on gh-pages branch
Idea: Use a workflow that would do that automatically on push
